   Landing Page & Navigation --> Auth --> Functionality --> Payment --> Launch.
2. shortcut key to select whole tag => ctrl + M
3. we gonna use shadcn "npx shadcn-ui@latest init"

6. we are going tRPC instead of fetch due to the better intelligence and auto-complete. but its bit tedious to setup tRPC.

7. using trpc you don't need to create api-endpoint.

a. install these dependencies :- npm install @trpc/server @trpc/client @trpc/react-query @trpc/next @tanstack/react-query zod

b. create provider component , create \_trpc folder inside app folder and create client.ts file inside \_trpc folder.

c. create trpc folder outside app folder but inside src folder

# Database :-

1. we are going to use prisma =>> npx prisma init . after this DATABASE_URL file will be generated in the env file.
2. we are going to use neon.tech for database because planet scale is asking for credit card details.

6. we are going to format time stamps by using "npm install date-fns"
7. while creating deleteFile function in index.ts trpc file you need to make input kinnda thing that you can see by yourself. we are doing this thing because it is post request.

# Creating our pdf File uploader.

1. pdf is not like images so that we can't renderer pdf like image therefore we gonna have to use different package like :- "npm install react-pdf"
2. for dragging and dropping functionality we gonna use a library "npm install react-dropzone".
3. for loading state we are using progress bar.
4. for file uploading we have two options :-
   a. S3 which is good for scalability
   b. we are using this for development because it doesn't required any credit card credentials "uploadthing.com"
5. Full docs of uploadthing for reference :-["https://docs.uploadthing.com/getting-started/appdir"]

1. for input we are going to install shadcn text-area component.
2. we are going to install another package "npm install react-textarea-autosize"

6. create API key in pinecone and paste it in .env
7. create separate file for pinecone under lib folder and install package (npm install @pinecone-database/pinecone)
